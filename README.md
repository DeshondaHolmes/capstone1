An e-commerce website template , built with HTML , CSS , and Bootstrap

# Welcome to CGC.

#Year up trainee
# Pluralsight 
# My first capstone project I was tasked to make a 5 page E-commerce website on something I was interested in , I scrapped many times until i found m theme colors:red, green , white, & black.

# My challanges: Choosing a topic , manually writing code word from word just to erase to start over.

# Overcoming my challanges: Re-Reading schoology workbook, watching youtube videos, and re-watch pluralsight videos. Re-read Bootstrap 5.3 docs and examples.

# My first capstone project.
