# Welcome to CGC.
Hello everyone, Good Day My name is Deshonda Holmes. 
Thank you for joining me , today I will present my FIRST capstone project
    IAM
     A
#Year up trainee
# Pluralsight 
# My first capstone project I was tasked to make a 5 page using HTML 5, CSS3, AND BOOTSTRAP 5.3 FOR AN  E-commerce website on something I was interested in , I scrapped many times
until I found my theme colors:red, green , white, & black.

# My challanges: Choosing a topic , manually writing code word from word just to erase to start over.

# Overcoming my challanges: Re-Reading schoology workbook, watching youtube videos, and re-watch pluralsight videos. Re-read Bootstrap 5.3 docs and examples.

# My first capstone project.


# My code is available on github
